        <h2>Summoner's Rift</h2>
        <p>Historically, the forest where the Rift resides was the site of several battles between the Protectorate
            (Stag crest) and Magelords (Owl crest) summoners, two sides who sought out to use the natural magical energy
            of the area for their personal use.

            The large amount of concentrated magic has mutated the local wildlife. From giant frogs, Giant
            Birds to Two-headed Wolves it has also attracted the attention of powerful
            Dragons who currently reside in one of the battle torn ruins. Sentinels,
            Bramblebacks and Krugs are creatures made from local flora and earth infused to construct a magical
            being. The Rift's unstable magic has inadvertently cause the reemergence of Baron Nashor, a
            large Serpent/Worm largely believed to be dead for centuries. It has his corruption affecting the land
            around him.</p>
        <h2>Twisted Treeline</h2>
        <p>After the fall of the Shadow Isles, the islands inhabitants were changed by the Black Mist. Numerous
            individuals and creatures now serve the Harrowing's will.

            Vilemaw Vilemaw is an ancient spider of unknown origin currently residing in the cursed forest. The "Cult of
            the Spider" has most of its followers located in Noxus and Demacia. Elise serves as its High
            Priestess, traveling to and from between the two nations and the Shadow Isles, bringing her followers to
            live with the Spider God, Vilemaw, for eternity, or so they believe.</p>
        <h2>Bilgewater</h2>
        <p>Various monsters from across Runeterra, such as the Ironbacks, Ocklepods, Plundercrabs, and Razorfins are
            shipped through the black market and used for monster brawls.</p>
